# Burrito Masala website

This is a website I built for a theoretical food cart in my UX/UI class as part of my coursework for my Associates degree. The client requirements were a one page site that highlighted their 'Chipotle style' build your own burrito menu.

To satisfy these requirements I did some preliminary research on foodcarts in their area to figure out what features other sites implemented well and where these sites were lacking in UX/UI and accessibilty best practices. After this initial research, I created two user personas of the carts ideal customers so I had an idea of who I was building this site for. From there I created wireframes and content inventories for the features of the site. I coded the site using the Zurb Foundation framework.

Features of the site include:

- Mobile-first, responsive design.
- A custom logo and google maps icon I created in Adobe Illustrator.
- Scroll sensitive menu bar.
- Smooth scrolling to inpage anchor links.
- Social media integration using the AddThis sidebar widget.
- Custom photo editing using Adobe Photoshop
- An in-page 'burrito-builder' application for users to place their orders with integrated Twitter API.
- A classic photo gallery and list to replace the 'burrito-builder' for users without JavaScript eneabled.
- Yelp review widget.
- Google Maps API integration with layover to avoid mobile users getting 'trapped'.
- Font-awesome icons and Google fonts.
